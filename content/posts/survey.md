# Help shape the future of netdata!

On February 15 we published our first ever [user survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1lXKZd8YOKJxF1clQHkv8N1tx2rF4PqPjhRwLYDceA3g/edit). 
The reason was simple, we need your feedback. 

netdata is growing fast, not only in adoption, but also in terms of the size of the team dedicated 
to delivering Wow! moments to our users. We are already working hard on covering gaps that have been identified for a while. 
But we are also full of ideas about how we can make the lives of IT operators easier. In fact, there are so many initiatives 
we believe we should focus on, that it's sometimes hard to prioritize. So, instead of discussing endlessly amongst ourselves 
about what our community would really love to see from netdata tomorrow, we reached out to the real experts.

Naturally, one doesn't want to miss the opportunity of a survey to also ask people what they think and feel about netdata today. 
The relevant questions in our survey were formed in a way that would again let us validate the areas of improvement. 
What we didn't quite expect was the number of expressions of love we have already received. 

Many of us in the team are newcomers and we are trully humbled by the emotions this tool stirs in its users. 
The responses we already have make us fully aware of our tremendous responsibility, to continue to pleasantly surprise 
you at every turn of this amazing journey.

Of course, the larger the sample size, the better. So please spend 2 minutes to [help shape the future of netdata](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1lXKZd8YOKJxF1clQHkv8N1tx2rF4PqPjhRwLYDceA3g/edit)!
