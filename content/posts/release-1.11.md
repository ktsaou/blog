Hi all,

It has been 8 months since the last release of Netdata. We delayed releases a bit, but as you can see on these release notes, we were working hard to provide the best Netdata ever.

Thanks to synacktiv.com and red4sec.com, we fixed a number of vulnerabilities in the code base (check below), so release 1.11 of Netdata is the most secure Netdata so far. All users are advised to update to this version asap.

Netdata now has its own organization on GitHub. So, we moved from firehol/netdata to netdata/netdata! We also provide new docker images as netdata/netdata (the old ones are deprecated and are not updated any more).

Netdata community grows faster than ever. Currently netdata grows by +2k unique users and +1k unique installations per day, every day!

Contributions sky rocket too. To make it even easier for newcomers to get involved, we modularized all the code, now organized into a hierarchy of directories. We also moved most of the documentation, from the wiki into the repo. This is quite unique. Netdata is one of the first projects that organizes code and docs under the same hierarchy. Browse the repo; you will be surprised! Examples: data collection plugins, database, backends, web server, ARL, including benchmarks, etc.

Many thanks to all the contributors that help building, enhancing and improving a project useful and helpful to hundreds of thousands of admins, devops and developers around the world!

You rock!
