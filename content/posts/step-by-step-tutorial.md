Health monitoring and performance troubleshooting isn't easy. That's exactly _why_ we're building Netdata, to
democratize monitoring and make it accessible to anyone who's interested in learning more about their systems and
applications.

Of course, teaching a complicated topic isn't easy either.

We're lucky that Netdata takes part of this complexity off our shoulders. Though a one-line installation that works on
any Linux distribution (plus Docker and Kubernetes!), among others, you can start checking out the Netdata dashboard in
a matter of minutes. And you don't have to worry about configuration thanks to our community-defined defaults and
auto-detection of the services/applications you want to monitor.



That's why we wrote this step-by-step tutorial. To give you not code samples, or pre-build configurations, but rather
the _understanding_ you need to make Netdata work exactly the way you need it to.

## What is the step-by-step Netdata tutorial?

The [step-by-step Netdata tutorial](https://docs.netdata.cloud/docs/step-by-step/step-00/) is a comprehensive, 10-step
guide to help you understand all the fundamentals you'll need to set Netdata up on your systems, configure it the way
you need, monitor the services you're interested in, and make sure you don't miss a single important update.

While there is a lot of material to consume, it's broken up into sensible pieces, so you don't have to cover it all in a
single day. Think of it as a syllabus with 10 reading assignments.



## Why now?

When I was first chattting with Netdata's CEO and COO, Costa and Chris, respectively, they emphasized the importance of
education. The agent is already immensely popular, but its continued growth depends on the publics' ability to install it, understand it, and _gain value_ from it.

When I started working for Netdata in June 2019, I quickly realized how little I knew. Not just about health monitoring
and performance troubleshooting, but also a ton of Linux fundamentals, despite using Linux as my desktop (gasp!) for
nearly 20 years now. I often struggled with configuring collectors, managing the Netdata daemon, and configuring some of
the more complex setups, like backends or streaming.

Despite only understanding a fraction of Netdata's complexity, my job has always been to write new documentation and improve the ways we teach other

existing educational platform. All the while, I was _supposed_ to be writing new documentation, and improving existing
pages, for stuff I didn't fully understand.

## What's next?

As with most of the new documentation and tutorials I write, this one also ends with a **What's next?** section.
