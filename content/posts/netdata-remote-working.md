Remote working in Netdata
Tips from a fully distributed company

The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has forced many organizations to take unprecedented steps towards remote working. Based on our experience as a fully distributed company from our very beginning in 2018, all but a few of these organizations will have a bad experience and quickly revert to collocation, as soon as possible. Remote working is hard, even when it’s carefully planned and executed. When the transition is rushed and seen as a necessary, temporary inconvenience, failure is all but inevitable. In this post, we provide a few very practical tips to help the organizations interested in preventing this forced experiment from severely impacting their day-to-day business. Moreover, if your organization takes the advice seriously and has the drive and ability to quickly implement most of the changes, you may even recognize the opportunities that remote working provides. Perhaps you still won’t have an overall positive experience, but at least you may be willing to consider a more strategic shift after the current crisis ends.

Tip 1: Enable real-time collaboration

You absolutely need an instant messaging and a video conferencing application, accessible by all your employees, regardless of their department. Collaboration on shared artifacts may or may not be essential in your business, so we’ll spend less time on that.

1.1 Instant Messaging
 
You can’t get things done by just using email due to the long response times and overhead in writing formal responses. IM is fast, informal and still asynchronous enough to give people some breathing space when they need to concentrate on a task. We use Slack, which has a perfectly good free tier and an affordable paid version. Some specific tips on how to make IM a tool, instead of a nuisance:
Make the IM notifications discreet. If you get pop-ups every time someone types something in a channel you’re participating in, the interruptions will be constant.
Ensure anyone can create a public or private channel and invite anyone they want to it. There’s no sense in micromanaging communication. 
Use private channels sparingly to avoid administrative overhead.
Encourage everyone to create channels for socialization (e.g. random, fun, sports, games, etc.). This tip is quite important for a long-term use of remote working, as you need to somehow make up for the loss of personal contact.
Ask people to be online and responsive in IM during the agreed common working hours. We have moved beyond mandatory common working hours in Netdata, but we recommend that you start by specifying slots of at least a few hours a day, during which everyone must be online and responsive. 

1.2 Video Conferencing

Phone conferences are bad for remote working, not only due to the call costs, but mainly because they completely eliminate the nonverbal communication that is necessary for developing trust. It’s impossible to replace face-to-face, personal contact, but video conferencing is the closest substitute we have. At Netdata, we mostly use Google Hangouts, because it comes with the rest of the GSuite tools we use. It does its job, and we didn’t have to pay extra for it. You should also select something that comes free with your existing solutions, or use a solution that has a free tier, such as Zoom (the free tier has an annoying time limit on calls, but you can get used to it). We did not like the quality of the Slack video conferencing and did not upgrade to the enterprise GSuite plan, even though we needed recording. We just got a few paid Zoom licenses that we distributed to a few people, so they could organize the sessions that needed to be recorded. A few more tips on video conferencing:
Encourage people to have permanently running conference calls that function as virtual co-working spaces. It can be as simple as pinning a URL on their IM channel. People can be doing their normal work while in these conferences, it just allows for quick verbal communication.
Ensure everyone has a good microphone, a camera, and a stable internet connection with sufficient bandwidth. 
Ask everyone to keep their camera on at all times and monitor their reactions.
Watch out for distracted participants. It’s easy to be working on something else when no one is watching you.

1.3 Shared Artifacts

We are a software company, so GitHub is a no-brainer for our main collaboration tool. We also use Google Drive to collaborate on some documents, but we have decided to make GitHub our single source of truth for pretty much everything that is text-based, even for things unrelated to code, such as our company handbook. If you don’t already have a solution for quick and easy collaboration on artifacts, you need one, regardless of whether you stick to remote working or not.

Tip 2: Track work, not people

The constant question that comes up with remote work is how you ensure that people are actually working. We were absolutely clear on that from the beginning: we do not care about time; we care about results. You absolutely must have a way of tracking tasks and deliverables and center all your management processes around those backlogs. There are countless task and project management tools out there. The bare minimum to ensure is that all work is recorded in the tool. If you need to track time spent as well (we don’t), you should ensure that the tool you select supports time tracking.

Since we were already using GitHub for the most important work we do as a company, we decided to purchase ZenHub, a product that literally sits on top of the GitHub user interface and provides additional necessary features. Every team in the company now has at least one GitHub repository, even without artifacts, so that we can keep track of our work via GitHub issues. We rely on ZenHub’s Kanban view to do our daily or weekly reviews of progress towards our goals.

The exact process we follow depends on the team and the learnings we’ve had from multiple iterations. Some teams use Scrum, others Kanban, others were just formed and are only starting. As long as you are insistent on the work being recorded in your tool of choice, you don’t have to worry about whether people are actually working or not.

Tip 3: Minimize formal meetings

Your natural inclination may be to set up a lot of meetings, to make up for the lack of face to face time and to maintain an illusion of control. In fact, if you follow tips 1 and 2, you’ll realize that you don’t need more meetings than what you probably have already. Short, daily standups and the Scrum ceremonies every two weeks are enough for the engineering teams that follow Scrum. Daily standups and weekly review and planning meetings are enough for the teams that follow Kanban. You will always need other calls of course, but treat them as you would be treating face-to-face meetings. You don’t have people sitting in a meeting room all day, so you don’t want them doing that from home either (note that the virtual co-working space mentioned in 1.2 is not the same thing).

What you will and will not see during the forced experiment:

Assuming that you’re in a company that hadn’t tried remote working at such a large scale before, there are a few fundamental challenges that you will be happy to NOT encounter:
The challenge of establishing trust in a remote working environment does not apply to you. Your people have worked together in an office, so it’s already as good as it will get. You don’t have to - and actually shouldn’t right now - set up expensive get-togethers, or try tactics like a virtual watercooler, to get people to feel like part of the team.
You don’t need to deal with multiple time zones for the first time, so you don’t have to adapt your processes.
You don’t need to screen out people with a “hired gun” mentality who look at remote work like contract work. 
You don’t have to set up expensive, elaborate training programs for junior hires. We circumvented this issue completely by only hiring experienced professionals at Netdata, but we realize that it’s not possible for every company.

On the other hand, you won’t be able to realize some of the biggest benefits of remote work:
Access to a global talent pool that you just can’t source locally, wherever you are.
Office cost-savings.
No 9-to-5 mentality. Depending on how you implement your long-term, remote working strategy, you may actually face the opposite problem, with people not being able to set boundaries, negatively affecting their work-life balance. It is possible that you will notice some changes even during the short experiment, but you are unlikely to see small teams of people working hard in the middle of the night, just because they didn’t finish what they had committed to during the day.

What you will definitely see is some teething problems that can be quickly resolved if you’re open-minded and have trust in your control process. You will probably see happier, more motivated employees, who are there for their families and there for their company as well, not just in physical form, but mentally. You will see easier collaboration between people who may be located in different parts of your office, possibly a lot more clarity on work done and work in progress, and perhaps even something you didn’t expect––better documentation of deliverables and processes.

Since we at Netdata never had offices, It should be obvious that the pandemic hasn’t impacted us as much as other companies. We did have to cancel our much-anticipated quarterly meet-up, some of our people had to rearrange their schedules and a couple of people who preferred working from co-working spaces had to stay at home. But most of us had been working mainly from home anyway, so the impact has been minor. We hope that our insights can help you get through this difficult period and that the emergency situation is resolved soon. But we also hope that you will not end the forced experiment in remote working with a bad taste in your mouth, because we are firm believers in its value.
