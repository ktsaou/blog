**Hello Netdata community**,

We are excited to announce that we are introducing new paid subscriptions to our SaaS offering. 

At Netdata, we believe in providing free and unrestricted access to high-quality monitoring solutions, and our commitment to this principle will not change. We will continue to offer the free Cloud SaaS offering and Open Source Agent, which features unlimited nodes and users, unlimited metrics, and retention, providing real-time, high-fidelity, out-of-the-box infrastructure monitoring for packaged applications, containers, and operating systems.

The new paid subscriptions are designed to provide additional features and capabilities for businesses that need tighter and customizable integration of the free monitoring solution to their processes, and they will be divided into three different plans: COMMUNITY, PRO, and BUSINESS. Each plan will offer a different set of features and capabilities to meet the needs of businesses of different sizes and with different monitoring requirements.

We understand that some of our users may have concerns about the introduction of paid subscriptions, so we would like to assure you that we will not be limiting access to features on the free plan. Instead, the free plan will continue to provide full access to all features available, and our paid subscriptions will allow you to control who can have access to which features.

We also want to inform you that we are reviewing our Role-Based Access model to provide better User Administration capabilities, with the following new roles being added:

- **Administrators** - This role allows users to manage Spaces, War Rooms, Nodes, and Users, this includes the Plan & Billing settings. It also allows access to all War Rooms in the space.
- **Managers** - This role allows users to manage War Rooms and Users. It also allows access to all War Rooms in the space.
- **Troubleshooters** - This role is for users that will be just focused on using Netdata to troubleshoot, not manage entities. It also allows access to all War Rooms in the space.
- **Observers** - This role is for read-only access with restricted access to explicit War Rooms.
- **Billing** - This role is for users that need to manage billing options and see invoices.

The legacy Member role will be deprecated, and new users will have to be Administrators on the free COMMUNITY plan.
